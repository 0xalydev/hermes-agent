"""Regression: Install-Uv stages the pinned uv and surfaces real errors.

History of this contract:

- Issue #69216: the old astral.sh-based Install-Uv swallowed installer
  output (``2>&1 | Out-Null``) and had one install source, so users only
  ever saw a generic post-condition failure. A three-rung fallback ladder
  (astral.sh, GitHub installer mirror, PATH salvage) fixed that era's
  design (3af56c220).
- The managed-runtime restack (779686046, c9febdde5) replaced the ladder
  entirely: Hermes owns its uv. Install-Uv now downloads the EXACT
  artifact pinned in installation/runtime-pins.json (URL + sha256 via the
  generated fragment), verifies the digest before extraction, and stages
  the binary at $InstallDir\\.hermes-runtime\\uv\\uv.exe -- inside the
  install-scoped managed runtime dir. PATH probing and
  non-pinned install sources are deliberately gone: a salvaged or
  latest-channel uv is a binary nobody reviewed.

These tests pin the NEW design's safety and UX properties:

1. No PATH-probing salvage rung comes back (managed-only invariant).
2. The download digest is checked BEFORE the archive is extracted.
3. The failure path still reaches the user: the caught error is printed
   (successor of the #69366 output-swallowing pin) and the manual-install
   docs pointer survives.
4. A staged binary whose version does not match the pin is replaced.

install.ps1 only runs on Windows, so these tests lock the contract at the
source-text level (same style as the other tests/test_install_ps1_*.py).
