 *   manifest.json          schemaVersion, tag, commit, platform, arch, python
 *   repo/                  plain source tree at the release tag (no .git),

 *                          so the interpreter resolves the runtime wherever
 *                          the app bundle sits — no venv, no PYTHONPATH.
 *   site-packages/         the full dependency tree from uv.lock, installed
 *                          at build time with `pip install --target` on the
 *                          payload interpreter. The backend runs directly
 *                          from here; nothing materializes at first launch.
 *   <tool>-<ver>-<target>/ managed runtime store entries (node, npm, uv,
 *                          gh, ripgrep; git on Windows), staged by the

 *                          runtimes.json facts the desktop reads at launch.
 *
 * Gating: the script does nothing unless HERMES_DESKTOP_VARIANT=bundled.
 * That variable is an internal build-time env for CI wiring, not user
 * config. Thus dev builds and current CI keep producing external builds.
 * There is no per-item skip: an embedded payload is complete, or this
 * script throws and the build fails.
 *
 * The heavy work shells out to git, uv, and tar. The decision logic
 * (target resolution, pip arg construction, manifest shape) is exported as
 * pure functions. Thus vitest covers it without network or toolchains.

 * cannot install. It failed as a pip error further down the build:
 * stt-whisper survived the gate, and `ctranslate2` publishes no
 * win_arm64 wheel and no sdist.
 *
 * Both lazy_deps target verdicts land in this one answer. `unavailable`
 * keeps an extra out — no wheel and no sdist exists, so demanding it
 * would only fail the build (onnxruntime on macOS x86_64). `build-wheel`
 * keeps the extra IN: an sdist exists, so pip compiles it on this runner

 *  - site-packages: pip already installs without tests for most wheels;
 *    the few residual test dirs are single-digit MB and package-owned.
 *
 * Pruned AFTER the 2026-08-18 re-audit (TODO item 10), with the machinery
 * that once justified keeping them now deleted from the tree:
 *  - Lib/ensurepip: the pip ladder's ensurepip tier is gone (uv-only);
 *    the venv-repair ensurepip calls (_early_recovery, _install_repair)
 *    run against a checkout's venv python, never the payload python —
 *    a sealed payload has no venv at all.
 *  - Lib/venv: eject is gone, and venv_sync creates venvs with `uv venv`
 *    (UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT), which does not import the stdlib module.
 *
 * Measured on the v0.27.0 win32-arm64 payload (1,268 MB installed):
 *  - PortableGit ships a full MSYS2 userland; git never calls the perl
 *    scripts Hermes can't reach (git-svn, send-email, legacy add -i),
 *    the HTML docs, gitk/git-gui, or the message catalogs. ~85 MB.
 *  - repo/ ships tests/ (34 MB) and website/ (27 MB) from git archive;
 *    nothing imports either at runtime.
 *  - the interpreter ships tcl/tkinter, idlelib, turtledemo and
 *    pydoc_data; no dependency imports tkinter (repo-wide grep). ~8 MB.

/**
 * Drop per-platform native libraries that this target can never load.
 *
 * The audit (`audit-bundle-arch.mjs`) fails a bundle that carries a
 * binary whose arch does not match `--arch`, and these wheels tripped it
 * with 16 mismatches per Linux lane. They are not a packaging mistake by
 * us: `pvporcupine` and `discord.py` publish `py3-none-any` wheels that
 * bundle every platform's libraries, so pip installs all of them
 * everywhere. The fix is to keep the one this target resolves.
 *
 * Every rule is read off the package's own loader:
 *
 *  - `pvporcupine/_util.py::pv_library_path` switches on
 *    `platform.system()` + `platform.machine()`. Note linux-arm64 does
 *    NOT use `lib/linux/` — that directory is x86_64 only. An aarch64
 *    Linux host resolves `lib/raspberry-pi/<cortex-*>-aarch64/`, and
 *    WHICH cortex comes from `/proc/cpuinfo` at import time, so all
 *    three aarch64 variants stay. The 32-bit `arm11`/`cortex-*` dirs
 *    require a 32-bit interpreter (`_is_64bit()` is false), which the
 *    payload's CPython never is.
 *  - `discord/opus.py::_load_default` loads `bin/libopus-0.<x64|x86>.dll`
 *    ONLY under `sys.platform == 'win32'`; every other platform goes to
 *    `ctypes.util.find_library('opus')`. So the whole `bin/` DLL pair is
 *    unreachable off Windows, and on Windows the bitness test picks x64
 *    (including win-arm64, where `struct.calcsize('P') * 8` is 64 and
 *    the x64 DLL runs under emulation — discord.py ships no arm64 opus).
 *  - `setuptools/_scripts.py::get_win_launcher` chooses a `cli`/`gui`
 *    stub by host platform when setuptools writes a console script.
 *    They are Windows PE launchers, inert on POSIX.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT pruned: `pvporcupine/lib/common` (the model file,
 * platform-neutral) and `resources/keyword_files/*` (data, not binaries).
